<img width="1620" height="900" alt="vanguard_image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bebff061-1dcb-4f6b-a5c3-28dad826cc67" />

This repository contains the analysis of an A/B test conducted by Vanguard to evaluate the effectiveness of a redesigned user interface (UI). The new UI introduced modern design elements and in-context prompts to enhance the user experience. This project explores the experiment's results, focusing on user behavior, completion rates, and efficiency improvements.

## Context & Study Design
This test was conducted to address a major pain point: Vanguard clients often abandon an essential online process— not due to a lack of intent, but because the interface frustrates them. These moments of friction impact efficiency, client satisfaction, and long-term revenue.

### Experiment Overview:
- **Duration**: March 15, 2017 – June 20, 2017
- **Control Group**: Used Vanguard's traditional online process.
- **Test Group**: Experienced the redesigned, modern interface.
- **Process Flow**: An initial page, three steps, and a confirmation page.

**Objective**: Determine if the updated UI improves completion rates and enhances the user experience.

# 📈 A/B Test Raw Data Exploration
The raw data consisted of three datasets capturing demographic, behavioral, and web interaction data:

1. **`df_demo` (Client Demographics and Behavior Data)**
   - Provides insights into client demographics, account details, and recent activity.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `clnt_tenure_yr`, `clnt_tenure_mnth`: Client tenure
     - `clnt_age`: Client age
     - `gendr`: Gender
     - `num_accts`: Number of accounts
     - `bal`: Account balance
     - `calls_6_mnth`, `logons_6_mnth`: Recent client activity

2. **`df_experiment_clients` (Experiment Group Data)**
   - Identifies which group (control or test) each client belongs to.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `variation`: Test or control group assignment

3. **`df_web_data_pt_1` and `df_web_data_pt_2` (Web Interaction Data)**
   - Captures client interactions with the online process.
     - `client_id`: Unique client identifier
     - `visitor_id`: Client-device identifier
     - `visit_id`: Web session identifier
     - `process_step`: Step in the online process
     - `date_time`: Timestamp of interaction

---

# ✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

### 1. **Merging and Consolidation**
   - Unified `df_web_data_pt_1` and `df_web_data_pt_2` into a single DataFrame (called df_web) using `pd.concat()`.
   - Merged demographic and experiment data (`df_demo` and `df_experiment`) using an outer join on `client_id`.
   - Merged unified web_data and experiment dara (`df_web` and `df_experiment`) using an inner joint on `client_id`. 

### 2. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Dropped rows with missing `control_test` values (~57% of rows).
   - Dropped rows missing demographic and the rows with missing numeric values were filled with the median.
   - Assigned "U" (Unknown) to missing gender values.

### 3. **Standardizing and Cleaning Columns**
   - Renamed columns to follow a consistent format: lowercase, underscores instead of spaces.
   - Organized columns for usability.

### 4. **Removing Duplicates**
   - Identified and removed duplicate rows based on `visit_id`, `client_id`, `process_step`, and `date_time`.

### 5. **Data Type Adjustments**
   - Converted `date_time` to a datetime format.
   - Adjusted numeric columns to appropriate types.

### 6. **Enhancements and Segmentations**
   - **Process Step Sorting**:
     - Added numeric prefixes to `process_step` (e.g., `start` → `step_1`) to ensure proper sorting. 
     - Converted `process_step` into an ordered categorical column for analysis.
   - **Chronological sorting of sessions per client_id**:
     - Sorted the dataset by `client_id`, `visit_id`, `date_time`to identidy the "first" row(session)  
   - **Age Groups**:
     - Segmented clients into age groups (e.g. young/adult/senior).
   -**Adding Seconds per Step**:
     - Calculated the seconds spend between each step and

- **75% of clients log on 8 or fewer times**, with the **top quartile being highly active (9+ logons)**.

## **Support Needs**
- Clients make an average of **3 calls per 6 months**.
- **75% of clients make 5 or fewer calls**.
- There’s a **strong correlation between logons and calls (Pearson = 0.99)**, with **logons occurring roughly twice as often as calls** (mean: **6.13 vs. 3.09**).
- The distribution is **consistent across control and test groups**.

## **Step Progression Efficiency**
- **Test group users progress more consistently** About 32-33% of the activity happens at the start, but only 12-14% reaches the **confirm stage**.

## **Seconds Spent Per Step**
- **Test group users take slightly less time per step**. But at the final **confirm stage**, as shown by the **higher concentration of time spent** there.

# ✨ KPI Insights

#### 1. **Global Completion Rate**
   - **Definition**: The number of users who reached the ‘confirm’ step (whithout having backward errors) divided by the total number of users.
   - **Control**: 65.59%  
   - **Test**: 69.29%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group shows an increase in completion rate compared to the Control group, which indicates that the changes implemented in the Test version had a positive impact on user engagement and the likelihood of completing the process.

#### 2. **Completion Rate**
   - **Definition**: The number of users who reached the ‘confirm’ step divided by the total number of users.
   - **Control**: 65.59%  
   - **Test**: 69.29%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group shows an increase in completion rate compared to the Control group, which indicates that the changes implemented in the Test version had a positive impact on user engagement and the likelihood of completing the process.

#### 3. **Average Time per Step (s)**
   - **Definition**: The average time spent by users on each process step, measured in seconds.
   - **Control**: 103.03 seconds  
   - **Test**: 116.86 seconds  
   - **Insight**: On average, users in the **Test group spend 13.84 seconds more per step than those in the Control group**. This increase is primarily driven by the confirm stage, where Test users spend significantly more time (**243.69s vs 168.73s**). While the Test group is actually faster in the initial start, step_2, and step_3 phases, the substantial time spent on the final step suggests that the new design may be encouraging deeper engagement or requiring more thorough review before completion.

#### 4. **Error Rate**
   - **Definition**: The percentage of users who move backward in the process, indicating errors or confusion.
   - **Control**: 53.21%  
   - **Test**: 54.70%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group has a higher error rate, which is a point of concern. This could be indicative of issues with the new interface or process flow, possibly creating confusion that leads to more errors, despite the higher completion rate.

#### 5. ** Overall Drop-Out Rate (Final Client Interaction) **
   - **Definition**: The percentage of users who left the process before reaching the last step (confirm).
   - **Control**: 41.87%  
   - **Test**: 32.68%  
   - **Insight**: The Test group demonstrates a lower drop-off rate, suggesting that users in the Test group are less likely to abandon the process. This reflects better retention, which could be attributed to the more engaging or user-friendly design in the Test group.

### **Overall Summary**  
- **Improved Process Completion**: The Test group shows higher completion rates and lower drop-offs, indicating that the changes introduced are generally favorable for user experience.
- **Enhanced Retention**: The Test group achieved a significantly lower drop-out rate of 32.68% compared to 41.87% in the Control group, indicating that users are more likely to stay in the funnel until the end.
- **Rise in Interaction Errors**: Despite higher completion, the Test group saw a slight increase in the error rate (54.70% vs. 53.21%), which may point to specific areas of confusion or friction within the new interface.
**Efficiency Trade-off:** The data reveals a trade-off where the Test design successfully drives more users to finish the process but requires more time and results in slightly more backward navigation compared to the Control version.
